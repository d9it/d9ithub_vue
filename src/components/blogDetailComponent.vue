                            <p>The website development process looks simple but the success of any website is a result of complex processes, brainstorming, collaboration, and endless communication between the project stakeholders, the website designers as well as the development team. The number one priority for any business looking to develop a website would be to meet the demands of customers in the best way possible. For this, website designers would have to understand the business objectives and customer needs to provide the best user experience in terms of both, UI & UX.</p>

                            <h4>Reasons Why UX is Important in Website Development</h4>

                            <h5>1) Optimized User Experience Boosts Web Traffic</h5>
                            <p>Statistics show that after the improvement of UX websites they experience a 67% increase in visitors. Wireframes/Prototypes designs before the development phase have proven to be helpful. It gives the customer precise information about what is going to be made, how the product is going to work.</p>
                            <p>Optimized UX is the ultimate solution that can significantly increase website traffic. It creates an instant impression over the new website visitors and appeals to them to revisit.</p>

                            <p>UI/UX designers can push the website users to look around by thoughtful design implementation and navigation that pleases the eyes and overall website experience. When the users navigate multiple web pages, they get more things to know about the business as well as the website or web app. They will definitely share the usability and experience with the people within their network.</p>


                            <h5>2) Strengthen Grip With User-Friendly User Interface (UI)</h5>
                            <p>Consider yourself browsing a website looking for some product or service. What if you couldnâ€™t find what you are looking for after 1-2 minutes? You will immediately leave the website and look for another one, right? Well, you are not alone. Everyone does that and hence bounce rate increases. This is why an optimized user interface (UI) is important too.</p>

                            <p>Another important aspect is the responsiveness of the website UI, as the world has literally gone to gadgets like smartphones, tablets, etc. A website is now meant to be accessed through any digital gadget and at all times. This requires website UI to be completely responsive and compatible with all the devices of all the platforms. Responsive website development is the primary requirement.</p>


                            <h5>3) Better UX Makes Website SEO Friendly</h5>
                            <p>Every website owner craves for their web pages to appear in the top index (top 10 results) on the Google search engine. The days are far gone now when keywords stuffing was being done to boost the SERPs. The recent Google algorithms like RankBrain, Hummingbird, Fred, Panda, etc. have given a huge emphasis on usability, accessibility, navigation, and other aspects of UI/UX designing along with content uniqueness and relatability.</p>


                            <h5>4) Optimize Website Usability via Comprehensive Testing</h5>
                            <p>Give immediate acknowledgment to the visitors that they are at the right place by putting relevant and precise information. Providing options while the user is performing any action helps in their decision making which helps them about what action they should take.</p>

                            <p>Architecture designing and implementation are crucial too. Information architecture works in regards to how a human brain perceives and utilizes information to efficiently organize data and content. And this can only be done perfectly by a UX designer.</p>
